"Designing and building the interior of HopyardBrewery has been an ongoing challenge. Working on refurbishing the interior of a 100 year old grain cellar from the bare structure up to match safety regulations has given me the opportunity to gain insight on the other side of the construction proccess. Responsible for all interior design and lighting decisions, I have been able to put design ideas I have been developing into practice."
