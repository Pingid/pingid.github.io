# Skynet Kitchens
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======

An installation for the Science Museum (London) during a show on food and agriculture. It was an interactive piece where participents could use machine learning to buid recipee combinations then test the recipees with cocktail sticks and the 40 different ingredients on offer..

I wrote an iPad app which used Foodpairing's machine learning API to rate different ingredient combinations as well as suggest additional ingredients that might improve the flavour of the combination.

Behind the stand I had project a live visualisation of the ingredient combinations that people had saved when using the app.





rate recipees and suggested additional ingredients which would in combination yield better flavours

Skynet was famously the name of the arteficial general intelegence which played the antagonist in the Terminator franchise. A melevolant superintelegence has been a long standing theme in much of science fiction and with what some have coined as the AI revolution it has begun to feel slightly less fictional. The uses of machine learning that most of us experience are there to predict our tastes and to understand our thoughts and behavour. This project was about exploring how machine learning and AI might soon go beyond the abstract and digital into enhancing our direct and tangable experiences. I chose to reference the artificial intelegence in terminator to emphasise that the project was not simply a display of the capabilities of machine learning but a question around how far we are willing to accept a computer take over our experiences.

The installation was built for the science musium (London) in a series on food and agriculture. Utilizing Foodparing.com API I wrote an iPad app which rated recipees and suggested additional ingredients which would in combination yield better flavours. For the installation I set up a stand with 40 different ingredients which included fruits, vegetables, herbs, cheeses and sweets. Participants were able to use the ipads to build ingredient combinations and were then invited to try their combinations out using cocktail sticks to combine the ingredients on offer. They were also encouraged to save good recipees which were then projected as a visualisation behind the stand so as to allow other particapents to try the often strange and surprising combinations.
