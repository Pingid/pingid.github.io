The starkest of these differences was between the 19th and 20th centuries where the art became much more abstract. There also seemed to be a correlation between the recentness of the year and quantity of work shown with half the exhibition taken up by 20th century art work."

What made the piece stand out among the other sculptures was the contrast between the dark lines on the lighter plaster. They make the piece look as though it is made from separate chunks and gives it an almost space age look.  I discovered later that Moore himself singled it out as one of his most important sculptures saying that it was the ‘first sculpture in which I succeeded in making form and space sculpturally inseparable’ (Christie’s, 2016)."

He goes on to define a sign by splitting it into two components the signifier and signified. The signifier is the literal sign: sound, image, text, and the signified is the concept or idea that the sign is referring to. Daniel Chandler, in his book ‘Semiotics: the basics’, questions whether semiotics is really a science he describes the word as ‘misleading’ pointing out that ‘semiotics involves no widely agreed theoretical assumptions, models or empirical methodologies.’ (Chandler, 2006, p. 4)."

This definition when applied to culture and the arts may not fit so well since much of the value we find in culture is not monetary. Neoclassical economics has a broader definition, it defines value as the rational preference of one outcome over another (Weintraub, 1993). This definition allows us to look more broadly at value while staying within the economic confines of rational thought. In this essay, I start by defining what I am referring to when I use the term the culture. Using the neoclassical definition of value, I try and pick apart what cultural commodities are and how they are different to other goods and services. I look at ways of measuring this value and the problems that arise as a result. Finally, I look at why measuring the value of culture matters at all."

Williams defines the abstract noun ‘culture’ as describing ‘the works and practices of intellectual and especially artistic activity’ (Williams, 1983, p.87). These definitions allow us to talk about culture in reference to a way of life and talk about art as a cultural commodity."

Impact assessment can be split into three subcategories, direct impacts, indirect impacts and induced impacts. Direct impacts are the gross value of the goods and services (GVA) and the cost of employment. Indirect impacts are the economic impacts through the supply chain. Induced impacts are the effects of the spending by those employed within the industries. Size or footprint analysis is used to understand whether a sector is significant to the economy however, it doesn’t include indirect effects and so the information it gives is limited. Cultural satellite accounts look at many cultural industries accounts in including the accounts of the suppliers and distributors in order to evaluate the national contribution. This is often used when measuring the size of sectors that are not industries such as tourism or unpaid housework. (Crossick and Kaszynska, 2016, p89-90)"

Sterngold notes that problems arise when substitution effects are not taken into account. For example, you might want to measure the potential economic impact of a new cinema, it is not enough to just measure the gross income generated because a proportion of that income will be income originally generated by another business. In other words by funding a project like a cinema you might just be shifting people's spending from one business to another and not actually generating new wealth for the regen (Sterngold, 2004). It is also important to note that impact studies are not an exact science but a best estimate if multiple impact studies are done they will in all probability yield different results (Crompton, Lee, and Shuster, 2001). Because of this, it is important to be critical of impact studies done and especially any vested interest of authors or funding bodies. "

This does not seem to be the case with artistic labour where ‘financial rewards are generally lower’ and there is a  ‘high variability of artists earnings’ (Ginsburgh, 2006, p9). Ginsburgh also notes the there are  ‘non-pecuniary motives where artists care more about their work than financial incentives’ (Ginsburgh, 2006, p9)."

A key aspect of the SROI method is that it stresses the importance of a ‘detailed report containing qualitative, quantitative and financial data that explains the judgements and decisions made over the course of the analysis’ (Jardine and Whyte, 2013, p22). A detailed qualitative and quantitative report would help to eliminate the problem that impact assessments suffer from which is that they are hard for non economists to fully understand and so be critical of."

This is done by weighing up all the benefits and dividing by all the costs. To estimate the value of the the library Tessler uses Total Economic Valuation (TEV) which takes account of both use-values and non-use values. The ‘use values are’ all the benefits felt by users of the library such as the reading-rooms, document supply, web-services etc. The ‘non-use values’ are ‘existence value’ which is ‘The value attached to the existence of the Library irrespective of whether a person ever visits it or not.’, ‘bequest value’,  ‘The value which the current generation places on preserving the Library for the benefit of future generations’ and ‘option value’, ‘This represents the value attached to potential future benefits from the Library.’. To work out the values of the amenities offered by the library they surveyed users asking how much the users were willing to pay (WTP) for their usage. For ‘non-use values’ surveys were sent out to nation wide ‘as to ensure that the respondents reflected the UK population distribution’. 55% of the surveys received back were from people who had never heard of or used the library and by asking ‘If you were free to choose how your existing taxes were allocated, what would be the maximum you would be willing to pay’, the average amount received back was £8.15 which is over double what is currently being paid. The study concluded that ‘The benefit cost ratio of 4.9 indicates that for every £1 invested in the Library in 2011/12, the Library generated £4.90 in economic welfare’. (Oxford Economics, 2013)"

The real difficulties arise when knowing whether the numbers you have come up with truly reflect the actual value. In this essay, I have addressed the cultural sector as a whole rather than looking at its constituent parts. This might be the wrong way of addressing the question ‘how to measure economic value?’, it might be better to focus on sectors of culture such as the music, museums, public art, architecture etc. There are of course other ways to measure the value of culture, one of the most promising being (SROI), which might do a much better job of reflecting the true value culture has to people and society. It seems there is still too little evidence to say which method is the most accurate and it is likely that the best method will be specific to the situation it’s used in."

We also talked more broadly about the different disciplines that come under design which are neatly illustrated in Thomas Pluralvonglas (2009) venn diagram on the right. In this essay I explore further what interaction design means, what sort of problems it is there to solve and touch on what it means to my own work."

Due in part to the rate at which they are developing and also the fact that they tend not to be built by designers eminently focused on the end user but by engineers trying to solve technical problems. I still see many especially in the older generations who struggle to understand and use computers. Or atleast it is hard for them to see the benefits when the time and energy investment for them to learn these systems is so large. Interactions design questions usability it inspects our behaviour and analyzes the choices we make (Kolko, 2009). This is why I believe it can play an important role in not only making technology more accessible but question the way we use it."

This is one of the criticisms of the qualitative approach since the ‘researcher's presence has a profound effect on the subjects’ and thus experiments are not repeatable  (Hughes). Despite its shortcomings it plays an important role in studying complex systems it is the qualitative approach which often leads to new insights and opens avenues for further quantitative research (Hughes)."

The results of the research are structured tables of values and statistics. Computers allow researchers to process large data sets making it possible to make accurate generalizations and predictions. Quantitative research only works in systems where you can totally isolate variables and when this is the case it can be effective at understanding true objective relationships. (USB Libraries, 2016)"

With the camera on a dolly, it tracks people one at a time as they make there way across the road. Each of the people had a unique walk often suffering from an ailment. Without the jubilant rock song playing in the background it could have been almost pitiful. Instead, I felt captivated by the struggles that some endured. It was a chance to examine the unique walks of those that politeness might not normally allow us to do. I believe it is the elated music in the background which changed the tone of the piece from that of pity to that of stoicism."

Raymond Williams (1953), describes William Wordsworth's use of the word in The Prelude (1995) as ‘genuinely transitional’; when he uses the word in both the older sense of process, ‘be left to droop by timely culture unsustained’, but also uses it as an absolute, ‘Salutes the Being at his birth, where grace of culture hath been utterly unknown’. This according to Raymond Williams was the first time culture was used in the modern sense of the word (Williams, 1953)."
