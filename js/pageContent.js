      p1: "I grew up in a small town in south east England where I quickly learned that the internet was a wonderful window into the outside world. I studied fine art then design at school and it was a small step to channel those skills into the digital realm.",
      p2: "It has always been of utmost importance to understand the tools that I use which has lead me for the past two years into software and front-end development. In this time I have developed a solid grasp of javascript and some of the libraries and frameworks.",
      p3: "When it comes to design I place great value in form following function and try to live by Steve Jobâ€™s statement 'Never let a passion for the perfect take precedence over pragmatism'."
